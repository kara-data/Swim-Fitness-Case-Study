# Swim-Fitness-Case-Study
Figuring out prep needed for a successful open water swim event

I’m fat, in my 50s, and love to swim. A goal is to swim the Hellespont with my sister in 2025 to celebrate her 60th birthday.

This Europe-to-Asia swim is an approximately 3 mile open water course in strong currents. Swimmers must finish in 1.5-2 hrs (I’ve seen both times cited) or they’ll be pulled out of the water by boats for shipping lanes to reopen. So I wondered….

What preparation do I need in order to finish the Hellespont swim successfully?

In 2022 I swam several times a week and participated in one organized open water event, but didn’t track any information about my swims. These swims mostly took place in my local pool, but also a couple other pools I visited, several ponds, a lake, a reservoir, a bay, and the ocean. At the end of the year I knew little about distances swum or my speed (or lack thereof) in the water, nor how speed was affected by open water conditions.

For 2023 I set some random goals to get started:

-Swim 200 miles this year

-Swim <30 minute miles regularly

-Swim three miles straight in a pool

-Compare pool swims to open water swims

*I have 2024 and half of 2025 to set new open water specific goals. For now, I want to increase my stamina and distances in a pool, and begin to understand how my pool swims compare to open water swims.

With this in mind, I began collecting data.

Begin to build fitness for a 3 mile sub 1:30 hour swim

On January 3, 2023 I began tracking my time, distance, swim location, and a few notes for each of my swims in Google Sheets. I do not have a fitness tracker watch, so am tracking manually using the big pool clock / timer. I am not focused on split times, but session totals. Speed matters for the event, but it comes second to stamina. It wouldn’t matter how fast the first mile was if the pace of the second and third were much slower.

When viewing the data you can see that:

-I don’t do well in the water when I’ve eaten, and I struggle with cramps (notes column)

-If I swim more than once in a day, there are separate entries for each session (see January 11th or 24th)

-I don’t detail stroke changes or drills. If I stop to rest for a few seconds or to negotiate with other swimmers in a lane, that time is not deducted. For example, on January 24th I did kicking drills. Those laps are a lot slower than swimming, but they’re just folded in to the totals. Or January 11th when I decided to have a slow, mellow swim in the evening. It’s all averaged together

-My pool is closed a lot. It’s at a school, so I don’t get to swim weekends, holidays, or when there’s any school closure or event. It can also get very crowded during community hours, which affects what I’m able to accomplish

-I used the following standards / formulas:

  -1 lap = one up and back (50 yards) in the 25 yard pool
  
  -1 mile = 33 laps. While not exact, this is considered a “swim mile”

Note that I was initially tracking based on 32 laps equalling one mile. Double checking this information at the time of my first analysis showed me that was incorrect. Therefore, I updated my spreadsheet formula. Though it was hard to see the numbers go down, I’m grateful to have realized my mistake early on.

1 Analysis - 50 miles in

I am the main stakeholder here since I really really want to be successful at the Hellespont event. I don’t want to be picked out of the water by a boat—that’d be so deflating! And it’d be a perk to finish the race before my sister who is generally more fit than I.

But the swim organizers play in, too. They need to know that I’m not a liability, and am not likely to require a rescue.

So, am I on the right track?
Because it’s not a huge amount of data, I’m able to analyze directly in Sheets using formulas, pivot tables, and charts. I see that:

✅ I am on track for my first two 2023 goals:

Goal 1 - Swim 200 miles this year

<img width="276" alt="Initial Mileage Goal" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115660389/220196337-4d9c4303-806f-4805-916e-7a0434c2dd23.png">

In 7 weeks I’ve swam more than 50 miles. This was a surprise to me, but again, I had no idea of what distance I was covering last year. If I continue at this rate (without illness or lack of access), I could swim ~400 miles in 2023.

7.76 average weekly mileage x 52 weeks = 403.5

Goal 2 - Swim <30 minute miles regularly

<img width="541" alt="mile_time" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115660389/220196495-87da3ac5-f3fb-4839-b058-d2f8e08d9053.png">

By week four I’d managed a sub 30 minute mile, and by week six averaged <30 more often than not. The trend line shows my average time is decreasing.

Goals 1 and 2 blended - Goals 1 and 2 need to work together, meaning, I need to be sure that I’m not speeding up during my shorter swims only. To do this stamina check, I filtered to only swims longer than 2 miles.

<img width="1092" alt="Stamina Check" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115660389/220196560-6a217b20-91c7-478e-bde3-dcd7f4e8a889.png">

Whew! Trends in this subset of data are consistent with the overall trends. However, there are only six data points, so re-checking this subset when there’s more data will be important.

Goals three and four need more time:

Goal 3 - Swim three miles straight in a pool

<img width="544" alt="mileage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115660389/220196609-c1d24df3-623b-41f3-b258-8407ad92042f.png">

Though I’ve had a handful of 2+ mile swims (and am inching closer to 3), my swims are not consistently longer distance. The trend line shows only a slight increase. The morning crowds mean that sometimes I only get half hour in the pool.

Goal 4 - Compare pool swims to open water swims

I live in the Northeast of the U.S. (hello, winter) and in an area where many natural bodies of water are closed to swimmers. I’ve been kicked out of most of them. The cold weather and open water restrictions mean that it’ll require summer travel to see how open water swims compare.

Other interesting tidbits:

-Using a pivot table to examine variances based on time-of-day, I see that I swim further in the evenings, and faster in the mornings.

-With one exception, cramps only affect my evening swims.

-Based on the weekly mileage viz, it looks like high mileage weeks tire me out, and require some lower-mileage recovery time in the following week. I’ll continue to watch to see if this up and down trend (with an overall slow climb) continues.

#1 Action Plan

-Locate swim venues where there’s time to swim three miles, and that are open on weekends and holidays

-Adjust 2023 total mileage goal from 200 to 365. This number is more in line with current mileage, and leaves some flexibility for illness or other unforeseen breaks. Plus, a mile a day has a nice symmetry to it

-Continue to monitor mileage, speed, and other factors. Re-analyze stamina based on varied distances

-Consider adding body weight and dryland workout data to the tracker. This added information may (or may not) add more refinement to the overall data and future action plans

-Perform analysis #2 when there are several more weeks of data available, but before adding open water swim data to the mix
